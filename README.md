# my-first-multilayer-perceptron
This program is a challenge I made for myself before I learned how to properly
build a multi layer perceptron. It was to figure out on my own how to build a
multi layer perceptron from a single layer perceptron only knowing what a hidden
layer does and not how to code one.
